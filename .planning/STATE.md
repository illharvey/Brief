# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-25)

**Core value:** A person picks their interests once, and every day at their chosen time, Brief delivers everything they need to know — without toxicity, ads, or algorithmic manipulation.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Email Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 7 (Email Infrastructure)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase (02-02 complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-01 — Completed plan 02-02: Email send helpers, unsubscribe endpoint, webhook handler, /unsubscribed page

Progress: [████░░░░░░] ~20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: ~5 min
- Total execution time: ~35 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 5 | 14 min | 3 min |
| 02-email-infrastructure | 2 | 21 min | 10 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-04 (8 min), 01-05 (5 min), 01-06 (n/a), 02-01 (15 min), 02-02 (6 min)
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- No X/Twitter integration — API cost prohibitive; conflicts with anti-toxicity goal
- Closed beta for PoC — validate with 10-20 real users before public infrastructure
- RSS + AI summarisation — best quality/cost ratio at small scale
- [01-01] Used neon-http driver over neon-serverless WebSocket — simpler, no connection pooling needed at this scale
- [01-01] Auth.js tables extended with custom columns (passwordHash, onboardingComplete) — DrizzleAdapter ignores unknown columns
- [01-01] deliveryTime stored as HH:MM string in IANA timezone — converts to UTC at dispatch time to avoid DST bugs
- [01-01] userTopics normalized as rows not jsonb — enables Phase 6 co-occurrence queries for PREF-04
- [Phase 01-02]: authorize() is in auth.ts only — auth.config.ts has authorize: undefined to prevent Edge runtime crash from Node.js crypto module
- [Phase 01-02]: JWT strategy specified in both auth.config.ts and auth.ts — DrizzleAdapter used only for user/account persistence, not session rows
- [Phase 01-02]: loginRatelimit uses analytics: false to preserve Upstash free tier headroom
- [Phase 01-03]: signUpAction returns userId for onboarding_user_id cookie — no auto-sign-in; email verification blocks briefing dispatch, not UI
- [Phase 01-03]: resolveUserId checks session first then onboarding cookie — same action code works during and after onboarding
- [Phase 01-03]: saveDeliveryPreferenceAction returns userId on success for confirmation page ?uid= query param
- [Phase 01-03]: Rate limit identifier is login:{email} not login:{ip} — per-email soft lock without blocking shared IPs
- [Phase 01-04]: TopicInput built from shadcn Command+Popover+Badge — no external chip library; freeform topics always allowed
- [Phase 01-04]: TimePicker uses Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone — no library needed for browser timezone detection
- [Phase 01-04]: confirmation/page.tsx receives userId as ?uid= search param from delivery page — server components cannot read cookies set immediately before navigation
- [Phase 01-05]: login/page.tsx uses useEffect + router.push for redirect — correct pattern when useActionState is a client hook
- [Phase 01-05]: dashboard/layout.tsx redirects to /login without callbackUrl — middleware handles callbackUrl injection for protected routes
- [Phase 01-05]: dashboard/page.tsx intentionally minimal placeholder — Phase 6 will replace entirely
- [02-01]: react-email installed as devDependency only — preview server not needed in production
- [02-01]: No image assets in email templates — text-only branding per user preference for simplicity
- [02-01]: emailSuppressions.email has unique constraint — one row per address; Plan 02-02 webhook handler uses upsert pattern
- [Phase 02-02]: HMAC-SHA256 stateless tokens for unsubscribe — no DB table needed, 30-day expiry, timingSafeEqual prevents timing attacks
- [Phase 02-02]: Webhook always returns 200 for unhandled event types — Resend retries on non-2xx responses causing duplicate suppression inserts
- [Phase 02-02]: FROM_ADDRESS and APP_URL centralized as constants in email.ts — not repeated in auth.ts or other callers

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research] Auth.js v5 stable release status — was beta at August 2025 training cutoff; verify before Phase 1 planning
- [Research] Phase 2: Verify current Resend free tier limits and Google/Yahoo bulk sender enforcement thresholds
- [Research] Phase 3: Article body extraction library choice has LOW confidence — verify @extractus/article-extractor vs readability maintenance status; verify NewsAPI free tier limits
- [Research] Phase 5: QStash stage-chaining API specifics have LOW confidence — read current Upstash docs before Phase 5 planning
